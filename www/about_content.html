<p><h3>What can I do with Ottawa Watch?</h3></p><p><strong>Keep track of City Council and Committee meetings as they are published</strong>. The City&#39;s e-Agenda tool is great, but it requires that you check in to find out what&#39;s going on. Ottawa Watch monitors the agendas and minutes automatically and will tweet when new documents are found. So follow @OttWatch and you&#39;ll never miss an update.</p><p><strong>Find out who&#39;s lobbying the City</strong>. Lobbyists are required to file reports within 15 days of any lobbying activities. But again, do you really want to check the Lobbyist Registry every day? I don&#39;t. The @OttWatch twitter account will let you know when lobbyists have entered their data.</p><p><h3>Do you have other features in mind?</h3></p><p>I most certainly do!</p><p><h3>Could you make Ottawa Watch do X, Y or Z?</h3></p><p>Probably. Drop an email to kevino@kevino.net, or tweet me at @odonnell_k, and let me know.</p><p><h3>How did you do all this? The dark arts? Can you share the software?</h3></p><p>After I get a few more features implemented and there&#39;s a bit of spit and polish to this thing I&#39;ll upload the source code to GitHub. I&#39;m using PHP and Ephiphany for the REST style web application, and Bootstrap for the look and feel.</p><p><h3>Why are you doing this?</h3></p><p>If you follow my main kevino.ca site you&#39;ll know I&#39;m into politics, so I have goals there. But the values that spur me to work on this project are rooted in open-government, transparency, and accountability. The City of Ottawa is making good progress on opening up data and making it easier for citizens to engage. Ottawa Watch&nbsp;couldn&#39;t happen without the City opening up as much as it already has. I have some technical skills, so my goal is to help open up the data even more, and make it available to a wider audience. You&#39;ll see what I mean when some more features come out. There&#39;s a method to the madness!</p>
