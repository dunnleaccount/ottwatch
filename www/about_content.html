  <h3>What can I do with Ottawa Watch?</h3>

  <div class="row-fluid">
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Keep track of City Council and Committee meetings as they are published</strong>. The City's e-Agenda tool is great, but it requires that you check in to find out what's going on. Ottawa
  Watch monitors the agendas and minutes automatically and will tweet when new documents are found. So follow @OttWatch and you'll never miss an update.</p>
  </span>
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Find out who's lobbying the City</strong>. Lobbyists are required to file reports within 15 days of any lobbying activities. But again, do you really want to check the Lobbyist Registry
  every day? I don't. The @OttWatch twitter account will let you know when lobbyists have entered their data.</p>

  <h3>Do you have other features in mind?</h3>
  <p>I most certainly do!</p>
  </span>
  <span class="span6">
  <h3>Could you make Ottawa Watch do X, Y or Z?</h3>
  <p>Probably. Drop an email to kevino@kevino.net, or tweet me at @odonnell_k, and let me know.</p>

  <h3>How did you do all this? The dark arts? Can you share the software?</h3>
  <p>After I get a few more features implemented and there's a bit of spit and polish to this thing I'll upload the source code to GitHub. I'm using PHP and Ephiphany for the REST style web
  application, and Bootstrap for the look and feel.</p>

  <span class="span6">
  <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
  <p>If you follow my main kevino.ca site you'll know I'm into politics, so I have goals there. But the values that spur me to work on this project are rooted in open-government, transparency, and
  accountability. The City of Ottawa is making good progress on opening up data and making it easier for citizens to engage. Ottawa Watch&nbsp;couldn't happen without the City opening up as much as
  it already has. I have some technical skills, so my goal is to help open up the data even more, and make it available to a wider audience. You'll see what I mean when some more features come out.
  There's a method to the madness!</p>
